      <p>Last updated: March 17, 2026</p>
      <p>
        Please read these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) carefully before using SLAB Voice
        (&quot;the Service&quot;). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these
        Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service. These Terms constitute a legally binding
        agreement between you and SLAB LLC (&quot;SLAB Training&quot;, &quot;We&quot;,
        &quot;Us&quot;, or &quot;Our&quot;).

      <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        SLAB Voice is an AI-powered sales call transcription and analytics platform. The Service
        enables authorized users to record sales conversations, generate transcripts with automatic
        PII redaction, access training videos, and collaborate with their team through leaderboards,
        messaging, and performance insights.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility &amp; Account Access</h2>
      <p>
        Access to the Service is granted exclusively to authorized employees and representatives of
        companies that hold an active SLAB Training subscription. You must be at least 18 years old
        to use the Service. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
        credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. You agree to notify us
        immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Recording Consent &amp; Legal Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          IMPORTANT: Recording laws vary by jurisdiction. Before recording any conversation, you are
          solely responsible for obtaining all legally required consents from all parties.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many jurisdictions require the consent of all parties to a conversation before it may be
        recorded (&quot;all-party consent&quot; or &quot;two-party consent&quot; laws). By using the
        recording feature, you represent and warrant that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have obtained all required consents from all parties to the conversation.</li>
        <li>
          Your use of the recording feature is in full compliance with applicable federal, state,
          and local recording laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not use the Service to record any conversation in violation of any applicable law.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        SLAB Training assumes no liability for your failure to comply with applicable recording laws.
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless SLAB Training from any claims, damages, or penalties
        arising from your non-compliance.
      </p>

        <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        PII redaction is performed automatically as a convenience feature; it does not guarantee the
        complete removal of all personal data from transcripts. You should not upload recordings that
        contain sensitive information beyond what is necessary for your legitimate sales activities.
